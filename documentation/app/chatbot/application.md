# **Chatbot Software Template Deployable Application**

This Software Template creates a web application that will utilize the chosen model server and model(s) listed in [Chatbot Software Template Overview](./overview.md).

The following image depicts an example of what you can expect to see from your deployed application. This example displays a brief conversation with the deployed Chatbot. You can determine the speed of the response by choosing `Llamacpp_python` (slower) or `vLLM` (faster).

You should be very **clear** and **specific** when giving your prompt in order to obtain the best possible results. The less you leave up to interpretation the better!
